# Fencing

Boundary is `3570` x `2800`. `6370` total.

1.2m seems good against Augie.

Has a gate.

Rails 150mm down from top and up from bottom of pickets.

> Fix the rails to the posts with two 75 x 3.75mm galvanised bullet head nails. Joins in the rails should be butted together in the centre of the post notch. Stagger the joins in the rails over different posts. 
> Don't use plain steel nails, as they'll eventually rust and leave brown stains on the fence. Use galvanised fasteners for all outdoor fixings.
